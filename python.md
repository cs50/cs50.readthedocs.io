# `python`

Most of CS50's command-line tools require that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed, since CS50 [uses f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) and [assumes that keyword arguments are ordered](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0468/). (If you already have Python installed on your Mac or PC but didn't install it yourself, odds are it's an older version.) You can install the latest version of Python for

* Linux, via [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation),
* macOS, via [installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) or [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos),
* [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/),

and [other platforms](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
