# `render50`

`render50` is a command-line tool with which you can generate syntax-highlighted PDFs of source code. In years past, CS50 generated PDFs of students' submissions so that teaching fellows (TFs) could annotate the PDFs with typed feedback. These days, CS50 generates PDFs of lectures' source code so that students can annotate them during lectures and so that David has a printout of each lecture's source code in front of him during lectures!

PDFs can be annotated (for free) with:

- [Adobe Reader DC](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html) on macOS and Windows
- [Evince Document Viewer](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Evince) on Ubuntu Linux
- [Preview](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740) on macOS

```

## Examples

### Render a single file

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from a source file (e.g., `bar.c`), execute:

```
render50 -o foo.pdf bar.c
```

### Render multiple files

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from multiple source files (e.g., `bar.c` and `baz.c`), execute:

```
render50 -o foo.pdf bar.c baz.c
```

The source files will be rendered in the order in which they're specified on the command line.

### Include files

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from multiple source files, including only those that match some pattern (e.g., `*.c`), execute:

```
render50 -i "*.c" -o foo.pdf *
```

Take care to quote (or escape with `\`) any patterns with wildcards, lest your shell glob the pattern before `render50` can.

### Exclude files

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from multiple source files, excluding those that match some pattern (e.g., `*.h`), execute:

```
render50 -x "*.h" -o foo.pdf *
```

As before, take care to quote (or escape with `\`) any patterns with wildcards, lest your shell glob the pattern before `render50` can.

### Render two files side by side

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) with two source files (e.g., `bar.c` and `baz.c`) side by side, execute:

```
render50 -o foo.pdf -y bar.c baz.c
```

### Render files recursively

To recurse into directories, invoke `render50` with `-r`.

### Disable syntax highlighting

To disable syntax highlighting, invoke `render50` with `-C`.

### Rendering URLs

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) with a source file at a URL (e.g., https://github.com/cs50/render50/blob/master/render50), execute:

```
render50 -o foo.pdf https://github.com/cs50/render50/blob/master/render50
```

Note that URLs on `github.com` are handled specially: URLs of the form `https://github.com/*/*/blob/*` are resolved to `https://github.com/*/*/raw/*` so that the file is downloaded from `raw.githubusercontent.com`. And URLs of the form `https://gist.github.com/*/*` (and `https://gist.github.com/*/*#file-*`) are resolved to `https://gist.github.com/*/*/raw` (and `https://gist.github.com/*/*/raw/*`) so that the file is downloaded from `gist.githubusercontent.com`.

### Overriding page size

By default, `render50` outputs letter-sized (8.5" Ã— 11") pages in landscape orientation. To override that default, invoke `render50` with `--size SIZE`, where `SIZE` is [as prescribed by CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page/size). Supported values for `SIZE` thus include:

- `letter landscape`
- `letter portrait`
- `A4 landscape`
- `A4 portrait`
