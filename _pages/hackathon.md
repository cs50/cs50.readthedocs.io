# CS50 Hackathon

The CS50 Hackathon is an epic all-nighter in the [HBS Hives](http://shepleybulfinch.com/images/hub_images/sb_home_944x583_harvard_hi_2.jpg) atop the [i-lab](http://i-lab.harvard.edu/) in [Batten Hall](http://www.hbs.edu/maps/#15.5,91.7) at [125 Western Avenue](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=m&q=125+Western+Avenue%2C+Boston+MA&output=classic) during
which you can dive into your final project's implementation alongside
classmates and staff. If you choose to partake, you'll be asked to
propose three milestones for yourself that evening: a "good" one that
you intend to achieve no matter what; a "better" one that you think you
can achieve; and a "best" one that you hope to achieve. Felipe's will be
served around 9pm; Domino's will be served around 1am; and
those still awake at 5am will be treated to breakfast at IHOP.
Snacks and drinks will be served throughout the evening.
Gluten-free and vegetarian options will also be available.

**Space is limited, so attendance is lotteried. If you RSVPed for a spot
at this year's Hackathon, you should have heard from the CS50 Bot
already as to whether you have a spot or were waitlisted. If not, email
<heads@cs50.harvard.edu> to inquire.**

**Space at IHOP is even more limited, so attendance at breakfast may be lotteried separately, depending on how many classmates are still awake at 5am!**

## When to get there

### Harvard Students

So that check-in isn't overwhelmed (and you aren't stuck waiting in line!), do arrive at the HBS Hives per the times below (unless you've been confirmed by the CS50 Bot for late arrival, in which case just arrive asap). If you can't make your prescribed time or if you want to travel with your partner(s), that's fine; just let <heads@cs50.harvard.edu> know in advance so we know when to expect you.

| If your LAST name starts with... | arrive at HBS Hives at... |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A – G | 7:00pm |
| H – N | 7:15pm |
| O – Z | 7:30pm |

### Yale Students

So that we arrive in time for Hackathon's start, please meet outside Arthur K. Watson at 51 Prospect Street by *3:45pm* on Thu 11/30. You will be asked to fill out a brief waiver form before boarding the charter buses, which are scheduled for a prompt 4pm departure. Buses should have outlets and Wi-Fi, though best to charge all gear and download all files ahead of time, just in case. In addition, food will not be served until 9pm or so at the Hackathon, so best to order a bag lunch or bring other snacks with you for the ride. Finally, a reminder that if you take a bus to Harvard with us, you **must** return to Yale with us.

## How to get there

### Harvard Students

* If **walking** from, say, Out of Town News, [follow this route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Harvard+Square,+18+Brattle+St+%23352,+Cambridge,+MA+02138/125+Western+Ave,+Allston,+Boston,+MA/@42.3686033,-71.1295785,15z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89e37742bc65ca79:0x59ca183286a63b76!2m2!1d-71.11896!2d42.373532!3m4!1m2!1d-71.1254162!2d42.3666013!3s0x89e377610cfd3869:0x1025a278cd0f4aa5!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37761d7d4572b:0xaf083e816c6fc10c!2m2!1d-71.124626!2d42.363655!3e2). Odds are the walk will take 20+ minutes.
* If **taking the shuttle**, take the Allston Express to the i-lab (which is where the HBS Hives are), per the schedule for the [Allston Campus Express PM](http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/shuttle-van-services/shuttles-schedule/evening-nights-monday-friday); consult the column called **i Lab Western Ave**. Those are regularly scheduled shuttles, not CS50 Shuttles, so space will be limited.  Odds are the trip will take 10+ minutes.
* If **driving**, drive to [125 Western Avenue](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=m&q=125+Western+Avenue%2C+Boston+MA&output=classic) in Allston (aka Boston).  Metered parking is available **behind** the i-lab, in the lot whose entrance is on Western Avenue itself.

## FAQs

### Can I attend?

Space is limited, so attendance is lotteried. If you registered for a
spot at this year's Hackathon, you should have heard from the CS50 Bot
as to whether you have a spot! If not, email
<heads@cs50.harvard.edu> to inquire.

### Can I arrive late?

Yes, but only if you receive an email from the CS50 Bot confirming a
"late arrival" for you. (Space is limited, so we try to give preference
to those who can partake for the entire time.)

### Can I leave early?

If you really, really want to, yes.  If you leave before 3am, call the [Evening Van Service](http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/shuttle-van-services/evening-van-service) at 617-495-0400 before 2:30am to arrange for pick-up. If you leave between 3am and 5am, best to use [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) or [Uber](https://get.uber.com/) or call 617-782-5500 for a taxi. If leaving on foot, be sure to walk with multiple friends.

### Can I go to IHOP?

Space at IHOP is even more limited than the Hackathon itself, so attendance at breakfast may be lotteried separately, depending on how many classmates are still awake at 5am!

Please forgive if we can't accommodate everyone who'd like to go!

### How do I check in upon arrival?

First visit the check-in tables in the ground-floor lobby. Then complete your check-in at https://cs50.net/[cs50.net/checkin].

### How do I check out before leaving?

Simply visit [cs50.ly/checkout](cs50.ly/checkout)!

### What if I can't attend after all?

If the CS50 Bot confirmed your spot but you can no longer attend, please
email mailto:heads@cs50.harvard.edu[heads@cs50.harvard.edu] right away so that we can give your spot to
someone who might be waitlisted.

### What if my partner was waitlisted but I wasn't?

Let <heads@cs50.harvard.edu> know.

### When does it end?

By 5am for folks who're sleepy and by 7am for folks who're awake (and hungry!) for IHOP, though [attendance at breakfast might be lotteried](#can-i-go-to-ihop).

### When does it start?

Around 7pm, but do check [when to get there](#when-to-get-there).

### Will there be food and drinks?

Yes! With so many folks in attendance, though, do try to be gentle with quantities. 

### Will there be gluten-free food?

Some, yes. It'll be set aside, so just check with the staff as to where it is.

### Will there be shuttles?

#### Harvard Students

*If, because of mobility impairment or medical condition, you find it difficult or impossible to use Harvard's shuttles, do contact the http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/shuttle-van-services/evening-van-service[Evening Van Service] in advance of the Hackathon to make arrangements to and from the Hackathon.  Just let mailto:heads@cs50.harvard.edu[heads@cs50.harvard.edu] know if you need a hand.*

##### To the Hackathon?

Yes, via regularly scheduled shuttles. But space will be limited, so it's probably best to walk to the Hackathon instead with friends.

With that said, you can take the Allston Express to the i-lab (which is where the HBS Hives are), per the schedule for the [Allston Campus Express PM](http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/shuttle-van-services/shuttles-schedule/evening-nights-monday-friday); consult the column called **i Lab Western Ave**. Those are regularly scheduled shuttles, not CS50 Shuttles, so space will be limited. Odds are the trip will take 10+ minutes.

##### From the Hackathon?

Yes, via chartered CS50 Shuttles. Some of the shuttles will head to IHOP around 5am, depending on how many classmates are (still!) hungry, and some shuttles will head to the River houses, Yard, and Quad.

With that said, space will still be limited, even though we've literally reserved every shuttle that Harvard owns! So the shuttles destined for the River houses, Yard, and Quad might make multiple loops, in which case there might be a bit of a wait. But you're welcome to walk home with friends if you'd rather not wait!

Please forgive, especially if weary or grumpy at that hour, if we can't quite fit everyone into shuttles all at once!

#### Yale Students

##### To the Hackathon?

Yes, see [when to get there](#when-to-get-there).

##### From the Hackathon?

Yes, via the charter buses on which you arrived. On Fri 12/1 morning, these buses will depart for IHOP, where a bountiful (likely bleary-eyed) breakfast will be served. We'll then return to Yale, arriving around 10am.

### Will there be office hours?

Yes, but one-on-one help will be limited, as a goal of the Hackathon is
to remove the last of CS50's training wheels! TFs, TAs, and CAs will be
present for guidance, but they'll also be working on projects of their own!

If really in need of help, though, look for staff by the stairs where you checked in!

### Will there be gluten-free and vegetarian food?

Yes! There will be gluten-free and vegetarian options from Felipe's and Domino's in addition to fruit and veggies.

### Will there be Wi-Fi?

Yes. Connect to **HBSGUEST** or **Harvard University**. But best to download anything big (e.g., software, movies, etc.) beforehand, lest Wi-Fi at HBS be a bit slow with so many people on it!
