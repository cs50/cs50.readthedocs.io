# render50

`render50` is a command-line tool with which you can generate syntax-highlighted PDFs of source code. In years past, CS50 generated PDFs of students' submissions so that teaching fellows (TFs) could annotate the PDFs with typed feedback. These days, CS50 generates PDFs of lectures' source code so that students can annotate them during lectures and so that David has a printout of each lecture's source code in front of him during lectures!

PDFs can be annotated (for free) with:

- [Adobe Reader DC](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html) on macOS and Windows
- [Evince Document Viewer](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Evince) on Ubuntu Linux
- [Preview](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740) on macOS

## Examples

### Render a single file

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from a source file (e.g., `bar.c`), execute:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf bar.c
```

### Render multiple files

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from multiple source files (e.g., `bar.c` and `baz.c`), execute:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf bar.c baz.c
```

The source files will be rendered in the order in which they're specified on the command line.

### Include files

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from multiple source files, including only those that match some pattern (e.g., `*.c`), execute:

```text
render50 -i "*.c" -o foo.pdf *
```

Take care to quote (or escape with `\`) any patterns with wildcards, lest your shell glob the pattern before `render50` can.

### Exclude files

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) from multiple source files, excluding those that match some pattern (e.g., `*.h`), execute:

```text
render50 -x "*.h" -o foo.pdf *
```

As before, take care to quote (or escape with `\`) any patterns with wildcards, lest your shell glob the pattern before `render50` can.

### Render two files side by side

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) with two source files (e.g., `bar.c` and `baz.c`) side by side, execute:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf -y bar.c baz.c
```

To facilitate discussion thereof, the lefthand file's line numbers will be prefixed with `L` while the righthand file's line numbers will be prefixed with `R`.

### Render files recursively

To recurse into directories, invoke `render50` with `-r`.

### Override syntax highlighting

By default, `render50` uses [Pygments](https://pygments.org/)'s `default` stylesheet to for syntax highlighting but also supports all of the styles demonstrated at <https://pygments.org/demo/#try>. You can specify a style with `-S` as follows:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf -S emacs foo.c
```

#### Disable color

To disable color (e.g., for a black-and-white printer), you can use [Pygments](https://pygments.org/)'s `bw` style as follows:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf -S bw foo.c
```

However, that style might still boldface some keywords. You can further disable boldfacing (and color) as follows:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf -S "" foo.c
```

### Rendering URLs

To generate a PDF (e.g., `foo.pdf`) with a source file at a URL (e.g., https://github.com/cs50/render50/blob/master/render50), execute:

```text
render50 -o foo.pdf https://github.com/cs50/render50/blob/master/render50
```

Note that URLs on `github.com` are handled specially: URLs of the form `https://github.com/*/*/blob/*` are resolved to `https://github.com/*/*/raw/*` so that the file is downloaded from `raw.githubusercontent.com`. And URLs of the form `https://gist.github.com/*/*` (and `https://gist.github.com/*/*#file-*`) are resolved to `https://gist.github.com/*/*/raw` (and `https://gist.github.com/*/*/raw/*`) so that the file is downloaded from `gist.githubusercontent.com`.

### Overriding page size

By default, `render50` outputs letter-sized (8.5" Ã— 11") pages in landscape orientation. To override that default, invoke `render50` with `-p SIZE`, where `SIZE` is [as prescribed by CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page/size). Supported values for `SIZE` thus include:

* `letter landscape`
* `letter portrait`
* `A4 landscape`
* `A4 portrait`

Files' paths will be right-aligned atop each page (to allow for staples in top-left corners).

### Formatting for screen

To format output for screens (e.g., to display on a projector), invoke `render50` with `-s [SIZE]`. Supported values for `SIZE` include:

* `480p`
* `720p`
* `1080p`
* `4K`

Files' paths will be left-aligned atop each page.

If invoked without a value for `SIZE`, `render50 -s` alone will render pages at 480p (for visibility's sake on projectors).
