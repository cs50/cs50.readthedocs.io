# Docker

[CS50 IDE](ide) and [`cli50`](cli50) (as well as CS50's web apps) are implemented with [containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container), "a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings."

To run containers on your own Mac or PC, you just need to install a container platform like [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) (CE), which is freely available for

* Linux
  * [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
  * [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
  * [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
  * [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
* [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

and [other platforms](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms).
