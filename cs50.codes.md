# CS50's QR Code Generator

CS50's QR Code Generator is a web app at [cs50.codes](https://cs50.codes/) via which anyone can generate, from URLs, long-lasting QR codes, which can be copied to your clipboard or downloaded as a PNG. The URLs are encoded in the QR codes themselves; they're not HTTP-redirected through CS50's own servers.
