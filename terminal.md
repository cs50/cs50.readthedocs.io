# Terminal

TODO

If you'd like to install `render50` on your own Mac or PC, so that you can render PDFs without using CS50 IDE, you'll need a command-line environment:

- If running Linux or the like, you already have one! Open a terminal window in your usual way.
- If running Mac OS, you already have one! Open **Applications > Utilities > Terminal**.
- If running Windows, you'll need to install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about), which is only supported on  Windows 10. Once installed, [run `bash`](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/).
