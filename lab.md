# CS50 Lab

CS50 is a web app at <lab.cs50.io> that enables

* teachers to create step-by-step programming lessons (i.e., labs), providing incremental feedback at each step, and
* students to progress from an empty file (or starter code) to working code, with hints and feedback along the way.

To create a lab as a teacher, all you need is a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and a (public or private) [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). To log into and work on a lab as a student, all you need is a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Neither use case requires familiarity with `git` itself though if or once comfortable with `git`, you can create labs even more quickly via a command line!

CS50 Lab is essentially an enhanced version of [CS50 Sandbox](sandbox) that allows teachers to embed interactive instructions alongside a sandbox. As such, CS50 Lab is essentially a lightweight version of [CS50 IDE](ide) with problems' specifications embedded in students' actual programming environments.
