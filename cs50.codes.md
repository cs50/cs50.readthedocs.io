# CS50's QR Code Generator

CS50's QR Code Generator is a web app at [cs50.codes](https://cs50.codes/) via which anyone can generate, from URLs, long-lasting QR codes, which can be copied to your clipboard or downloaded as a PNG. The URLs are encoded in the QR codes themselves; they're not HTTP-redirected through CS50's own servers. 

## API

CS50's QR Code Generator supports, via GET, these HTTP parameters:

* `url`, the value of which is a URL to be encoded
* `level`, the value of which, if present, must be `L, `M`, `Q`, or `H` per [wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Error_correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Error_correction), the default value of which is `H`

A request (with a URL like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)) can be submitted via cURL with

```
curl -J -O "https://cs50.codes/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoHg5SJYRHA0"
```

which will save the QR code as `qr.png`.

The QR code can also be embedded with HTML like:

```
<img alt="QR code" src="https://cs50.codes/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoHg5SJYRHA0">
```
