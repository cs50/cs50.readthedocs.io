# `python`

Most of CS50's command-line tools require that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed, since CS50 [uses f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) and [assumes that keyword arguments are ordered](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0468/). (If you already have Python installed on your Mac or PC but didn't install it yourself, odds are it's a version older than 3.6.) You can install the latest version of Python, 3.7, for

* Linux, via [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)
* macOS, via [installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-macosx10.9.pkg) or [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x)
* [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe)

and [other platforms](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/).
